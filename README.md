**Project Title: Healthcare Insurance Management with Blockchain**

**Description:**
The Healthcare Insurance Management with Blockchain project aims to revolutionize the healthcare insurance industry by leveraging the power of blockchain technology. It provides a decentralized and secure platform for managing healthcare insurance policies, claims processing, and ensuring transparency and immutability of data.

**Features:**
1. **Blockchain Integration:** Utilizes blockchain technology for immutable and transparent record-keeping of insurance policies and claims.
2. **Decentralized System:** Removes the need for intermediaries, reducing costs and enhancing trust between parties.
3. **Smart Contracts:** Implements smart contracts for automating insurance processes such as policy issuance, premium payments, and claims settlements.
4. **User-Friendly Interface:** Offers a seamless user experience with an intuitive web-based interface developed using AngularJS.
5. **Secure Data Storage:** Integrates IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for decentralized and secure storage of documents related to insurance policies and claims.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Frontend:** AngularJS for building the client-side interface.
- **Backend:** Java for server-side development.
- **Database:** MySQL for storing user data and policy details.
- **Blockchain Platforms:** Utilizes Ethereum blockchain with tools like MetaMask for user authentication and Ganache for local blockchain development.
- **Smart Contracts:** Developed using Solidity and managed with Truffle framework.
- **Other Tools:** TypeScript for enhanced scalability, Bootstrap for responsive design, and FontAwesome for icons.
